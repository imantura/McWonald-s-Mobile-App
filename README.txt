App Description: 
-> This is an interactive menu I developed using Node.JS, which allows customer to place an order and see corresponding, relavent information to their order. McWonald's
has a hompage where you may access promotional detail and links to other pages. Two important links are the menu and a link to place an
order which will grant you a recciept. Your recciept utilizes your input to tell you when your food is ready. 
This app also relies on employee data, in which the employee is able to fullfill orders. 
Username: employee
Password: employee
The employee is able to fullfill customer orders and remove them form the database.
